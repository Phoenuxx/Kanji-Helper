# Japanese Flash Card
A little game to help  memorize Kanji and their meaning/pronunciation through a flash card style guessing scheme. As I learn/find new Kanji I want help memorizing the list will grow.

# Beginner Level
With the beginner level a randomly selected Hiragana or Katakana flash card will populate. You type in your guess and click submit to find out if you were right or wrong. Stuck on one? Scroll over the "Flash Card" to get the answer.

# Medium Level
At this level you're translating some common Kanji that are randomly selected from a list back into english. Stuck on one?  Scroll over the "Flash Card" to get a Hiragana hint.
